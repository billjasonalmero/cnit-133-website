      <h3>Comments:</h3>
      <p>Bill, nice work but let's see the details: a) in part 1 you are not testing if the user types a grade that is less than 0 (negative) or bigger than 100 (as requested). Also, you put a Notes field that you are allowing the user to type in. The other problem is that you are not showing the letter grade that corresponds to the total average (final average grade) of the student (-1.5); b) in part 2 you are not allowing me to input 0 (zero) as number of items sold?!? There is no request that the sales person WILL sell at least one of each item?!? Your test should be only < 0! The total weekly earnings is not correct - it should be $200 + 9% of the total that the sales person sold (-1.5). c) Part 3 is excellent as you did not present the final result with decimals! If you want, please share in the forum - the Homework 2 forum you will find in discussions, the link to the part 3 of your homework!</p>
