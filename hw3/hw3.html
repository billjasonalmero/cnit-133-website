      <p>Bill, nice work - in part 1 I would have formatted the numbers to be shown in the browser - I mean using , (comma) to separate thousands.  The label tags of the forms are not being used correctly and you should not use table to format forms - tables should be used to present tabular data only. (-0.3)<br>Part 2 is partially working - at first I clicked the submit button and received the error messages below and they all looked ok...but then I filled out the name box and clicked submit again and that message error about not having the name was still there...should have been gone and even after filling out everything and submitting - I saw you created an email to be sent but you did not clear the error messages (-1). Great work in part 3 - even the fact that the page is opening in another tab/window so the user does not have to use the back button of the browser to go back to your page!  Great work in part 4 too!  Please, if you want, share in the forum parts 3 and 4 of your work!</p>
